Supported datasets
===================

The maps supported can be of several types, vector or raster, editable or static.

There are two big categories of map types that need to be considered 
in Geopaparazzi: 

 * **basemaps**: the background map in the map view
 * **overlay maps**: vector maps that can be shown on top of the basemaps

All the maps need to be placed in the maps folder, which resides in a 
folder called *maps* in the **root of the sdcard**, if it is not changed 
in the :ref:`settings <custommapsfolder>`.

For the preparation of datasets listed in the following sections, refer to the 
:ref:`data preparation section <datapreparation>`.

Basemaps
-----------------

Basemaps can be of 4 different types:

* mapsforge maps
* mapurls
* mbtiles
* rasterlite2

.. index:: mapsforge maps
.. _mapsforgemaps:

Mapsforge maps
++++++++++++++++++

The mapsforge map if a file with **.map** extension.

Mapsforge maps are kindly generated by two different sources:

* mapsforge itself
* openandmaps

mapsforge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are the standard maps generated, maintained and distributed by the `mapsforge <http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/>`_
team and downloadable from `their server <http://download.mapsforge.org/>`_.

In their default style they kind of look like:

.. figure:: 06_maps/01_mapsforge_maps.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300px

openandmaps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Openandromaps <http://www.openandromaps.org>`_ generates maps following the opencycle 
theme, with isolines and more hiking related stuff. The map files are larger but worth 
every byte. Their `download area is here <http://www.openandromaps.org/en/download.html>`_.

With the Oruxmaps theme that is available from the download area, the maps look like:

.. figure:: 06_maps/02_cycle_maps.png
   :align: center
   :width: 300px

Apply a render theme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Geopaparazzi applies render themes if they are found on the disk. In order to be
found, the render theme xml file needs to have the same name as the map file. 
Ex, the above cycle map example has a::
    
    italy_cycle.map

and a::

    italy_cycle.xml

render theme file in the same folder as the map file itself.


Mapurls: Custom tiles based maps
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Mapurl files are definitions of tiles sources that can be local or remote.
Tile Sources definitions are simple text files that need to have the 
extention *.mapurl* to be recognised by Geopaparazzi.

Remote Tile sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An example for a remote tilesource is the mapnik mapurl dataset,
which is always included by default:

.. literalinclude:: /../../geopaparazzi-git/geopaparazzimapsforge/res/raw/mapnik.mapurl

The mandatory information is:

* the url of the tile server, having:

  - *ZZZ* instead of the zoom level
  - *XXX* instead of the tile column number
  - *YYY* instead of the tile row number
  
  This information can be tested also in a browser
  http://tile.openstreetmap.org/9/271/182.png has ZZZ=9, XXX=271 and YYY=182

* the minimum zoom level that is supported
* the maximum zoom level that is supported
* the center of the tile source
* the type fo tile server. Currently both `standard TMS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service>`_
  and google based numbering of the tiles is supported by the line:

  * type=tms
  * type=google

* the backup mbtiles path. This one is used to save downloaded tiles in the
  local mbtiles database

Also WMS works as remote source, as long as it can be accessed through an **EPSG:4326** projection. 

An example for the url part is::

    url=http://sdi.provincia.bz.it/geoserver/wms?LAYERS=inspire:OI.ORTHOIMAGECOVERAGE.2011&TRANSPARENT=true&FORMAT=image/png&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&STYLES=&EXCEPTIONS=application/vnd.ogc.se_inimage&SRS=EPSG:4326&BBOX=XXX,YYY,XXX,YYY&WIDTH=256&HEIGHT=256

Important here are:

* SRS=EPSG:4326
* BBOX=XXX,YYY,XXX,YYY

Local Tile sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Local tile sources are the useful ones, since they can be used offline.
Through those it is possible to load on any smarthphone complex maps as for 
example the following map that has a technical basemap with shapefiles 
overlayed in transparency

To be able to load such maps, one needs to prepare the tiles properly.
This can be done via in several ways as explained in the :ref:`data 
preparation section <datapreparation>`.

The tile folder have then to be loaded in the *maps* folder together
with the description of the tile source::

    url=mytilesfolder/ZZZ/XXX/YYY.png
    minzoom=12
    maxzoom=18
    center=11.40553 46.39478
    type=tms

Nothing changes against the description for the remote source apart of 
the url. The url in this case represents the relative path of the tiles 
folder starting from the *"maps"* folder.

**A note of warning:** Filesystems are know to have problems in handling
large amounts of very small files. This the exact case of local tile 
sources. If the dataset is large, it gets very hard to move the data 
from and to the device. Therefore this method, even if still supported, 
is flagged as deprecated. The **MBTiles** datasource, explained in the next 
section, should be used instead.
 

.. index:: mbtiles
.. _mbtiles:

MBTiles
+++++++++++++

MBTiles is a file format for storing map tiles in a single file. It is, technically, a SQLite database. 
See the `openstreetmap wiki <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MBTiles>`_ for more information.

.. index:: rasterlite2
.. _rasterlite2:

RasterLite2
+++++++++++++++

`RasterLite2 <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/librasterlite2/wiki?name=librasterlite2>`_ is a raster 
format implemented in the `spatialite database <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index>`_.

At the time of writing it is released as development version and supported in Geopaparazzi for testing.


Overlay maps
-----------------

The only datasets that can be overlayed on top of basemaps are vector maps
coming from a `spatialite database <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index>`_.
